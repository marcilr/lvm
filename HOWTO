Removing a logical volume
=========================
A logical volume must be closed before it can be removed:

# umount /dev/myvg/homevol
# lvremove /dev/myvg/homevol
lvremove -- do you really want to remove "/dev/myvg/homevol"? [y/n]: y
lvremove -- doing automatic backup of volume group "myvg"
lvremove -- logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" successfully removed

tldp.org/

Example (remove backups lvm on bornite):

# lvremove /dev/backups/backups 
Do you really want to remove active logical volume backups? [y/n]: y
  Logical volume "backups" successfully removed
# 


Removing a volume group
=======================
Make sure that no logical volumes are present in the volume group, see later section for how to do
this.

Deactivate the volume group:
# vgchange -a n my_volume_group

Now you actually remove the volume group:
# vgremove my_volume_group

Example (remove backups volume group on bornite):

Deactivate the volume group: 
# vgchange -a n backups
  0 logical volume(s) in volume group "backups" now active
#
        
Now you actually remove the volume group:
# vgremove backups
  Volume group "backups" successfully removed
#
