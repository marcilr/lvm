Create "backups" LVM
====================
Configured RAID5, with 4x Seagate ST31000340NS 1TB drives, attached to 9650SE-8LPML on bornite.
Need to configure a "backups" LVM for routine backups of the c0 unit (on 9650SE-16ML controller)
to the c5 unit on the 9650SE-8LPML controller.

# tw_cli info

Ctl   Model        (V)Ports  Drives   Units   NotOpt  RRate   VRate  BBU
------------------------------------------------------------------------
c0    9650SE-16ML  16        8        1       0       1       1      OK       
c5    9650SE-8LPML 8         4        1       0       1       1      OK       

#

1. Initialize physical volume on /dev/sdd1 partition using pvcreate.

# pvcreate /dev/sdd1
  Physical volume "/dev/sdd1" successfully created
#

This creates a volume group descriptor at the start of the /dev/sdd1 partition. 

# pvdisplay
...
  "/dev/sdd1" is a new physical volume of "2.73 TiB"
  --- NEW Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdd1
  VG Name               
  PV Size               2.73 TiB
...
#

2. Create backups volume group on /dev/sdd1 using vgcreate.

# vgcreate backups /dev/sdd1
  Volume group "backups" successfully created
#

# vgdisplay
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               backups
...
  VG Size               2.73 TiB
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
...
#

Looks good.

3. Activate "backups" volume group.
# vgchange -a y backups
  0 logical volume(s) in volume group "backups" now active
#

NOTE: Don't think this was necessary.  Likely active after creation.

3. Create backups lvm using lvcreate.

Want to use entire "backups" VG for the "backups" lvm.  Use vgdisplay to find the "Total PE"
size for "backups" VG.

# vgdisplay backups | grep "Total PE"
  Total PE              715247          <== Total size of "backups" VG.
#

Create "backups" LV in "backups" VG.
# lvcreate -l 715247 backups -n backups
  Logical volume "backups" created
#

This creates the "backups" LV filling the entire "backups" VG.

# vgdisplay
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               backups
  ...
  VG Size               2.73 TiB
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              715247
  Alloc PE / Size       715247 / 2.73 TiB
  Free  PE / Size       0 / 0
  ...
#

Appears to have worked.



Initializing disks or disk partitions
=====================================
Before you can use a disk or disk partition as a physical volume you will have to initialize it.

Use pvcreate to initialize a disk or disk partition.

Run pvcreate on the disk:
# pvcreate /dev/hdb

This creates a volume group descriptor at the start of disk.

NOTE: Using the whole disk as a PV (as opposed to a partition spanning the whole disk) is not
recommended because of the management issues it can create.  Any other OS that looks at the disk
will not recognize the LVM metadata and display the disk as being free, so it is likely it will be
overwritten.  LVM itself will work fine with whole disk PVs. 

Run pvcreate on the partition:
# pvcreate /dev/hdb1

This creates a volume group descriptor at the start of the /dev/hdb1 partition.


Creating a volume group
=======================
Use the 'vgcreate' program:

# vgcreate my_volume_group /dev/hda1 /dev/hdb1 

NOTE: LVM allows for absorbing or ejecting disks from the volume group.
      Similar to RAID0.


Activating a volume group
=========================
After rebooting the system or running vgchange -an, you will not be able to access your
VGs and LVs. To reactivate the volume group, run: 

# vgchange -a y my_volume_group


Adding physical volumes to a volume group
=========================================
Use 'vgextend' to add an initialized physical volume to an existing volume group.

# vgextend my_volume_group /dev/hdc1
                                    ^^^^^^^^^ new physical volume


Removing physical volumes from a volume group
=============================================
Make sure that the physical volume isn't used by any logical volumes by using then 'pvdisplay'
command:

# pvdisplay /dev/hda1

--- Physical volume ---
PV Name               /dev/hda1
VG Name               myvg
PV Size               1.95 GB / NOT usable 4 MB [LVM: 122 KB]
PV#                   1
PV Status             available
Allocatable           yes (but full)
Cur LV                1
PE Size (KByte)       4096
Total PE              499
Free PE               0
Allocated PE          499
PV UUID               Sd44tK-9IRw-SrMC-MOkn-76iP-iftz-OVSen7


If the physical volume is still used you will have to migrate the data to another physical volume
using pvmove.

Then use 'vgreduce' to remove the physical volume:

# vgreduce my_volume_group /dev/hda1
        

Creating a logical volume
=========================
To create a 1500MB linear LV named 'testlv' and its block device special '/dev/testvg/testlv':
# lvcreate -L1500 -ntestlv testvg
        
To create a 100 LE large logical volume with 2 stripes and stripe size 4 KB.
# lvcreate -i2 -I4 -l100 -nanothertestlv testvg
        
If you want to create an LV that uses the entire VG, use vgdisplay to find the "Total PE" size, 
then use that when running lvcreate.

# vgdisplay testvg | grep "Total PE"
Total PE              10230
# lvcreate -l 10230 testvg -n mylv
        
This will create an LV called mylv filling the testvg VG.

If you want the logical volume to be allocated from a specific physical volume in the volume group,
specify the PV or PVs at the end of the lvcreate command line.
# lvcreate -L 1500 -ntestlv testvg /dev/sdg


Removing a logical volume
=========================
A logical volume must be closed before it can be removed:

# umount /dev/myvg/homevol
# lvremove /dev/myvg/homevol
lvremove -- do you really want to remove "/dev/myvg/homevol"? [y/n]: y
lvremove -- doing automatic backup of volume group "myvg"
lvremove -- logical volume "/dev/myvg/homevol" successfully removed

tldp.org/

Example (remove backups lvm on bornite):

# lvremove /dev/backups/backups 
Do you really want to remove active logical volume backups? [y/n]: y
  Logical volume "backups" successfully removed
# 


Removing a volume group
=======================
Make sure that no logical volumes are present in the volume group, see later section for how to do
this.

Deactivate the volume group:
# vgchange -a n my_volume_group

Now you actually remove the volume group:
# vgremove my_volume_group

Example (remove backups volume group on bornite):

Deactivate the volume group: 
# vgchange -a n backups
  0 logical volume(s) in volume group "backups" now active
#
        
Now you actually remove the volume group:
# vgremove backups
  Volume group "backups" successfully removed
#
