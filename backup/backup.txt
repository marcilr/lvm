Backup


Think that using dd to copy and gzip to compress is the way to go.



Create disk image
=================
1. Boot from a liveCD or liveUSB.
2. Make sure no partitions are mounted from the source hard drive.
3. Mount the external HD
4. Backup the drive.
   # dd if=/dev/hda conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | gzip -c  > /mnt/sda1/hda.img.gz

5. Save extra information about the drive geometry necessary in order to
   interpret the partition table stored within the image.  The most important
   of which is the cylinder size.

   # fdisk -l /dev/hda > /mnt/sda1/hda_fdisk.info

NOTE: You may wish to use a block size (bs=) that is equal to the amount of cache on the HD you are backing up. For example, bs=8192K works for an 8MB cache. The 64K mentioned in this article is better than the default bs=512 bytes, but it will run faster with a larger bs=.
Restore system

To restore your system:

 # gunzip -c /mnt/sda1/hda.img.gz | dd of=/dev/hda

Examples with compression
=========================
When you need to create the hard drive or a single partition compressed
backup image file you must use compression tools which can do backup from
a stdout and the dd command.  Those compressed files cannot be mounted by
the mount command but are useful to know how to create and restore them.

7zip
----
Install the p7zip package from the official repositories.  This backup
example will split the dd command output in the files by up to the
100 megabyte each:

  dd if=/dev/sdXY | 7z a -v100m -t7z -si image-file.7z

Restore with 7zip:
  7z x -so  image-file.7z | dd of=/dev/sdXY

Note: 7zip can split only the 7z compression type files

[SOLVED]using dd to make image backup of logical volume?
========================================================
Create and restore LVM backups using dd.

Create backup:
  dd if=/dev/mapper/VolGroupArray-lvroot of=/mnt/backupdata/test1.img bs=16M
  dd if=/dev/mapper/VolGroupArray-lvhome of=/mnt/backupdata/test2.img bs=16M

Restore:
  dd if=/mnt/backupdata/test1.img of=/dev/mapper/VolGroupArray-lvroot bs=16M
  dd if=/mnt/backupdata/test2.img of=/dev/mapper/VolGroupArray-lvhome bs=16M
