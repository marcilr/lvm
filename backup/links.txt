Back Up (And Restore) LVM Partitions With LVM Snapshots
Version 1.1
Author: Falko Timme
This tutorial shows how you can create backups of LVM partitions with an LVM
feature called LVM snapshots.  An LVM snapshot is an exact copy of an LVM
partition that has all the data from the LVM volume from the time the snapshot
was created.  The big advantage of LVM snapshots is that they can be used to
greatly reduce the amount of time that your services/databases are down during
backups because a snapshot is usually created in fractions of a second.
After the snapshot has been created, you can back up the snapshot while your
services and databases are in normal operation.
Very, very good details here.
