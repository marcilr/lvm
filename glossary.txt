LVM Glossary
============

LVM - In computer storage, logical volume management or LVM provides a method of allocating 
  space on mass-storage devices that is more flexible than conventional partitioning schemes.
  In particular, a volume manager can concatenate, stripe together or otherwise combine 
  partitions into larger virtual ones that administrators can re-size or move, potentially 
  without interrupting system use.

LE - Logical Exit.  Each logical volume is split into chunks of data, known as logical extents. 
  The extent size is the same for all logical volumes in the volume group.

LV - Logical Volume.  The equivalent of a disk partition in a non-LVM system. The LV is visible as
  a standard block device; as such the LV can contain a file system (eg. /home).

PE - Each physical volume is divided chunks of data, known as physical extents, these extents have
  the same size as the logical extents for the volume group.

PV - A physical volume is typically a hard disk, though it may well just be a device that 'looks'
  like a hard disk (eg. a software raid device).

VG - The Volume Group is the highest level abstraction used within the LVM.  It gathers together 
  a collection of Logical Volumes and Physical Volumes into one administrative unit.
