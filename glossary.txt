LVM Glossary

LVM - In computer storage, logical volume management or LVM provides a method of allocating 
  space on mass-storage devices that is more flexible than conventional partitioning schemes.
  In particular, a volume manager can concatenate, stripe together or otherwise combine 
  partitions into larger virtual ones that administrators can re-size or move, potentially 
  without interrupting system use.
