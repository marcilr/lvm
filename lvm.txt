Configuring 5.45TB RAID6 on 3ware 9650SE-8LPML with logical volumes.


The /dev/VGNAME/LVNAME path is just a convenience symlink to /dev/mapper/...

lvm - Logical Volume Manager (LVM) 
      Physical Volume (PV)
      Logical Volume (LV)
      Volume Group (VG)

The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a subsystem for managing disk 
space. The HP LVM subsystem offers value-added features, such as 
mirroring (with the optional HP MirrorDisk/UX software), high 
availability (with the optional HP ServiceGuard software), and 
striping, that enhance availability and performance.

Unlike earlier arrangements where disks were divided into fixed-sized 
sections, LVM allows the user to consider the disks, also known as 
physical volumes, as a pool (or volume) of data storage, consisting 
of equal-sized extents. The default size of an extent is 4 MB.

An LVM system consists of arbitrary groupings of physical volumes, 
organized into volume groups. A volume group can consist of one or 
more physical volumes. There can be more than one volume group in 
the system. Once created, the volume group, and not the disk, is 
the basic unit of data storage. Thus, whereas earlier one would move 
disks from one system to another, with LVM, one would move a volume 
group from one system to another. For this reason it is often 
convenient to have multiple volume groups on a system.

Volume groups can be subdivided into virtual disks, called logical 
volumes. A logical volume can span a number of physical volumes or 
represent only a portion of one physical volume. The pool of disk 
space that is represented by a volume group can be apportioned into 
logical volumes of various sizes. The size of a logical volume is 
determined by its number of extents. Once created, logical volumes 
can be treated just like disk partitions. Logical volumes can be 
assigned to file systems, used as swap or dump devices, or used for 
raw access.

Remove volume group
-------------------
bornite:/# vgrename data-vol data
  Volume group "data-vol" successfully renamed to "data"


Scan volumes
------------
bornite:~# vgscan
  Reading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...
  Found volume group "data" using metadata type lvm2


Create logical volume
--------------------- 
Volume with 1TB capacity with name 'mp3', for data group:

bornite:~# lvcreate -n mp3 --size 1000g data
  Logical volume "mp3" created

Volume with 500GB capacity with name 'svnroot', for data group:

bornite:~# lvcreate -n svnroot --size 500g data
  Logical volume "svnroot" created
