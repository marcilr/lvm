lvreduce - reduce the size of a logical volume
==============================================
lvreduce  [-A/--autobackup  y/n]  [-d/--debug]  [-f/--force]  [-h/-?/--help] {-l/--extents
[-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|FREE}] | -L/--size [-]LogicalVolumeSize[kKmMgGtT]}
[-t/--test] [-v/--verbose] LogicalVolume[Path]

lvreduce allows you to reduce the size of a logical volume. Be careful when reducing a logical
volume's size, because data in the reduced part is lost!!! You should therefore ensure that any
filesystem on the volume is resized before running lvreduce so that the extents that are to
be removed are not in use. Shrinking snapshot logical volumes (see lvcreate(8) for information to
create snapshots) is supported as well.  But to change the number of copies in a mirrored logical
volume use lvconvert (8).

Sizes will be rounded if necessary - for example, the volume size must be an exact number
of extents and the size of a striped segment must be a multiple of the number of stripes.

Example
-------
Reduce /dev/mapper/data-music logical volume from 1TB to 500GB:
bornite:~# lvreduce -L500G /dev/mapper/data-music
