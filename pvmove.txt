pvmove - move physical extents


Sun Jun 12 19:25:58 AKDT 2011
=============================
Investigatiung how to use of pvmove to move allocated physical extents from one physical 
volume to other physical volumes.  In particular need to migrate columes from bornite's
debian etch to new debian squeeze amd64 install.

Also, possible to copy logical volume from one volume group to another?


Syntax
======
pvmove  [--abort]  [--alloc  AllocationPolicy]  [-b|--background] [-d|--debug] [-h|--help]
[-i|--interval Seconds] [--noudevsync] [-v|--verbose] [-n|--name  LogicalVolume]
[SourcePhysicalVolume[:PE[-PE]...] [DestinationPhysicalVolume[:PE[-PE]...]...]]

Options
=======
  --abort
       Abort any moves in progress.

  --noudevsync
       Disable udev synchronisation. The process will not wait for notification from udev.
       It  will  continue  irrespective of any possible udev processing in the background.
       You should only use this if udev is not  running  or  has  rules  that  ignore  the
       devices LVM2 creates.

  -b, --background
       Run the daemon in the background.

  -i, --interval Seconds
       Report progress as a percentage at regular intervals.

  -n, --name  LogicalVolume
       Move  only the extents belonging to LogicalVolume from SourcePhysicalVolume instead
       of all allocated extents to the destination physical volume(s).
