		     [without using Partition magic]

    1) install resize2fs
       (debian package: "e2fsprogs")
    
    2) install fdisk 
       (dunno which package, maybe something like fstools...)
    
    3) Decide whether you want to shrink or to grow your partition.

    Shrinking your partition:
    -------------------------

    Use "resize2fs <part> <size>" to resize your Filesystem. (no matter
    what fs you use, ext2 or ext3)
    <part> : partition, normally something like /dev/hda1, 2, 3, whatever,
             the partition you want to resize
    <size> : new size of your filesystem, can be something like
             20000M (for Megabytes)
	     20G (for Gigabytes)
	     (note that this is NOT the new size of your partition, only
	     the file system is going to be resized now)

    resize2fs will tell you how many (4k) blocks your file system is
    long from now on. KEEP THAT NUMBER IN MIND. (write it down or
    something like that)

    Multiply this number by 8. This is the amount of blocks which you
    need to specify when you run fdisk (which is the next step)

    Run "fdisk <dev>" where <dev> is you harddisk, NOT YOUR PARTITION
    (/dev/hda for example, NOT /dev/hda1, 2, 3, [...]). 
    
    - Type 'u' to change the view from cylinders to blocks.
    
    When you type 'p<return>', you see your partition table. 
    Chose the partition you resized with "resize2fs".
    (keep its number, its first and its last block in mind (again: 
    WRITE THEM DOWN _CORRECT_ !).
    
    - Type in 'd' to get into the deletion menu.
    - Type in the number of your partition.
    - Type in 'n' to recreate the partition.
    - Chose the type of your partition. (if you dont know, what 'primary'
      and 'extended' means, type in 'p')
    - Type in the number of the Partition (normally it is the same as the
      old one).
    - Type in the first Block of the old Partition.
    
    -- This is important: --
       remember the number you multiplied by 8? This is the length
       of the new Partition.
    
    - Type in '+<number>' where <number> is the number you multiplied by
      8.

    - Reboot and try to mount the new Partition. (maybe you will have to
      run fsck by hand)

    -- IMPORTANT --
    If something goes wrong, do not give up. When resize2fs did not
    report any errors, your data is still "there". Repeat the steps
    concerning fdisk.
    
    
    Growing your partition:
    -----------------------

    If you want to grow your partition, you will first have to
    repartinio it with fdisk and then growing the filesystem to the
    correct size with resize2fs.

    Use cfdisk to ease up the process of reparting your partition.
    Grow it to the size you wish to. (when using cfdisk, this is fairly
    easy, because one can tell cfdisk the size in MB, not in cylinders
    or blocks, etc).

    After that, use resize2fs:
    
    Use "resize2fs <part> <size>" to resize your Filesystem. (no matter
    what fs you use, ext2 or ext3)
    <part> : partition, normally something like /dev/hda1, 2, 3, whatever,
             the partition you want to resize
    <size> : new size of your filesystem, can be something like
             20000M (for Megabytes)
	     20G (for Gigabytes)
	     (note that this is NOT the new size of your partition, only
	     the file system is going to be resized now)
    
    Thats all. Reboot and try to mount your new filesystem.


NOTE: NO WARRANTY for correctness of the given information, at least it 
      worked for me...
