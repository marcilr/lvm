Resize ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem on the volume using resize2fs.


resize2fs - ext2/ext3 file system resizer
=========================================
resize2fs [ -fFpPM ] [ -d debug-flags ] [ -S RAID-stride ] device [ size ]

The resize2fs program will resize ext2 or ext3 file systems.  It can be used to enlarge or shrink
an unmounted file system located on device.  If the filesystem is mounted,  it can be used to
expand the size of the mounted filesystem, assuming the kernel supports on-line resizing.
(As of this writing, the Linux 2.6 kernel supports on-line resize for filesystems mounted
using ext3 only.).

The size parameter specifies the requested new size of the filesystem.  If no units are specified,
the units of the size parameter shall be the filesystem blocksize of the filesystem.  Optionally,
the size parameter may be suffixed by one of the following the units designators: s, K, M, or G,
for 512 byte sectors, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively. The size of the filesystem
may never be larger than the size of the partition.  If size parameter is not specified, it
will default to the size of the partition.

The resize2fs program does not manipulate the size of partitions.  If you wish to enlarge a
filesystem, you must make sure you can expand the size of the underlying partition first.  This
can be done using fdisk(8) by deleting the partition and recreating it with a larger size or using
lvextend(8), if you're using the logical volume manager lvm(8). When recreating the partition,
make sure you create it with the same starting disk cylinder as before! Otherwise, the resize
operation will certainly not work, and you may lose your entire filesystem.  After running
fdisk(8), run resize2fs to resize the ext2 filesystem to use all of the space in the newly
enlarged partition.

If you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use resize2fs to shrink the size of filesystem.
Then you may use fdisk(8) to shrink the size of the partition.  When shrinking the size of the
partition, make sure you do not make it smaller than the new size of the ext2 filesystem!
