Expand lvm


The time has come to expand the movies lvm again.  I've documented these
expansions under lvm/bornite/volumes.txt  However, the time has come to
get a separate document going to document the techiques.


Examples
========

Fri Jan 23 08:18:59 AKST 2015
=============================
Noticed that the 1.8TB movies lvm (1.8T) was 99% full with only 20G
available.  Going to increase size to 1.9T.

1. Umount movies logical volume:
bornite:~# umount /data/movies/

2. fsck movies logical volume:
bornite:~# e2fsck -f /dev/data/movies
e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
/dev/data/movies: 24425/235929600 files (26.5% non-contiguous), \
443235878/471859200 blocks
bornite:~#

Looks good.

3. Extend movies logical volume from 1.8TB to 1.9TB
(not enough space for 2TB):

bornite:~# lvextend --size 1.9T /dev/mapper/data-movies
  Rounding up size to full physical extent 1.90 TiB
  Extending logical volume movies to 1.90 TiB
  Logical volume movies successfully resized
bornite:~# 

4. Resize filesystem on movies logical volume to 400GB:
bornite:~# resize2fs /dev/mapper/data-movies
resize2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Resizing the filesystem on /dev/mapper/data-movies to 510027776 (4k) blocks.
The filesystem on /dev/mapper/data-movies is now 510027776 blocks long.

bornite:~#

5. Remount movies
bornite:~# mount /data/movies/

bornite:~# df -h | grep movies
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
...
/dev/mapper/data-movies
                      1.9T  1.7T  156G  92% /data/movies
bornite:~#

=============================
Expanded the vms lvm, in the tennantite group on my 2TB Seagate ST32000641AS
external drive on the GCI Network Services, OSS covellite workstation:

1. Unmount vms logical volume:
# umount /mnt/tar/vms/

2. fsck vms logical volume:
# e2fsck -f /dev/tennantite/vms
e2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
/dev/tennantite/vms: 70/19660800 files (0.0% non-contiguous), 70566527/78643200 blocks
#

3. Extend logical volume from 300GB to 400GB:
# lvextend --size 400G /dev/tennantite/vms
  Extending logical volume vms to 400.00 GiB
  Logical volume vms successfully resized
#

4. Resize filesystem on logical volume to 400GB:
# resize2fs /dev/tennantite/vms
resize2fs 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)
Resizing the filesystem on /dev/tennantite/vms to 104857600 (4k) blocks.

5. Mount vms logical volume and inspect:
# mount /dev/tennantite/vms /mnt/tar/vms/
# df -h | grep vms | grep tennantite
Filesystem                     Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/tennantite-vms     394G  265G  110G  71% /mnt/tar/vms

Looks good.

=============================
The movies expans from 1700GB to 1800GB did not work.  Only the lvm got expanded
not the filesystem.  Need to fix this.

1. Run e2fsck for resize2fs.
bornite:~# e2fsck -f /dev/data/movies 
e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
/dev/data/movies: 23389/209715200 files (26.7% non-contiguous), 416505720/419430400 blocks
bornite:~# 

2. Run e2fsck pm movies without size specified.  This should use the complete
size of the lvm.

bornite:~# resize2fs /dev/mapper/data-movies
resize2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Resizing the filesystem on /dev/mapper/data-movies to 471859200 (4k) blocks.
The filesystem on /dev/mapper/data-movies is now 471859200 blocks long.

bornite:~# 

Wow, looks good.

3. Mount movies
bornite:~# mount /data/movies
bornite:~# df -h | grep movies
/dev/mapper/data-movies
                      1.8T  1.6T  119G  93% /data/movies
bornite:~#

Got my space!

4. Start services
bornite:~# /etc/init.d/samba start
Starting Samba daemons: nmbd smbd
bornite:~# /etc/init.d/plexmediaserver start
Starting Plex Media Server: done
bornite:~#

Back in action!

=============================
Expand movies lvm from 1700GB to 1800GB

1. Check space available to volume group using vgs:
bornite:/home/marcilr# vgs
  VG      #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize  VFree  
  backups   1   1   0 wz--n-  2.73t      0 
  bornite   1   1   0 wz--n- 74.52g      0 
  data      1  20   0 wz--n-  5.46t 289.87g
bornite:/home/marcilr# 

2. Stop services using /data/movies:
bornite:~# /etc/init.d/plexmediaserver stop
Killing Plex Media Server: done
bornite:~#

bornite:~# lsof /data/movies
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
smbd    19796 root  cwd    DIR 253,13    12288    2 /data/movies
bornite:~#

bornite:~# /etc/init.d/samba stop
Stopping Samba daemons: nmbd smbd.
bornite:~#

bornite:~# lsof /data/movies
bornite:~#

3. unmount /data/movies:
bornite:~# umount /data/movies/

4. Run e2fsck on /dev/data/movies to keep resize2fs happy:
bornite:~# e2fsck -f /dev/data/movies
e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
/dev/data/movies: 23294/209715200 files (26.8% non-contiguous), 388639238/419430400 blocks
bornite:~#


5. Use lvextend to increase volume size to 1800GB:
bornite:~# lvextend --size 1800G /dev/data/movies
  Extending logical volume movies to 1.76 TiB
  Logical volume movies successfully resized
bornite:~#

6. Resize /data/movies from 1700GB to 1800GB:
bornite:~# lvextend --size 1800G /dev/data/movies
  Extending logical volume movies to 1.76 TiB
  Logical volume movies successfully resized
root@bornite:~# resize2fs /dev/mapper/data-movies 1800GB
resize2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
resize2fs: Invalid new size: 1800GB

bornite:~# 

7. Inspect results:
bornite:~# lvdisplay /dev/data/movies
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Name                /dev/data/movies
  VG Name                data
  LV UUID                dkZcFm-SQ5S-3eKm-EZHl-2QM7-z0LF-3KAv11
  LV Write Access        read/write
  LV Status              available

  LV Size                1.76 TiB
  Current LE             460800
  Segments               5
  Allocation             inherit
  Read ahead sectors     auto
  - currently set to     256
  Block device           253:13
   
bornite:~#

Looks good!

8. Mount /data/movies and start services.

bornite:~# mount /data/movies/
bornite:~# /etc/init.d/samba start
Starting Samba daemons: nmbd smbd.
bornite:~#
bornite:~# /etc/init.d/plexmediaserver start

Very good!
