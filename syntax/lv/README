Filelist
========
lvcreate.txt
  Create logical volume with filesystem

lvextend.txt
  lvextend allows you to extend the size of a logical volume.  Extension
  of snapshot logical volumes (see lvcreate(8) for information to  create
  snapshots) is supported as well.

lvreduce.txt
  lvreduce allows you to reduce the size of a logical volume.  Be careful when  
  reducing a logical volume's size, because data in the reduced part is lost!!!
  You should therefore ensure that any filesystem on the volume is resized 
  before running lvreduce so that the extents that are to be removed are not 
  in use.  Shrinking snapshot logical volumes (see lvcreate(8) for information  
  to create snapshots) is supported as well.  But to change the number of
  copies in a mirrored logical volume use lvconvert (8).

lvremove.txt
  lvremove - remove a logical volume

lv.txt
  Logical Volume (LV) 

resize2fs.txt
  Resize ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem on the volume using resize2fs
