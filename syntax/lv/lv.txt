Logical Volume (LV)

LVM (Logical Volume Management) commands.
  dmsetup      - low level logical volume management

  lvdisplay    - display attributes of a logical volume
  lvextend     - add space to logical volume
  lvreduce     - reduce size of logical volume
  lvremove     - remove a logical volume
  lvrename     - rename a logical volume
  lvscan       - nice list of logical volumes

LVM information can be created, displayed, and manipulated with the following commands:
  lvchange     - Change logical volume characteristics
  lvcreate     - Stripe, create logical volume in volume group
  lvdisplay    - Display information about logical volumes
  lvextend     - Increase space, increase mirrors for logical volume
  lvlnboot     - Prepare logical volume to be root, primary swap, or dump volume
  lvmmigrate   - Prepare root file system for migration from partitions to logical
                 volumes
  lvreduce     - Decrease number of physical extents allocated to logical volume
  lvremove     - Remove one or more logical volumes from volume group
  lvrmboot     - Remove logical volume link to root, primary swap, or dump volume

The following commands are also available if the HP MirrorDisk/UX software is installed:
  lvmerge      - Merge two logical volumes into one logical volume
  lvsplit      - Split mirrored logical volume into two logical volumes
  lvsync       - Synchronize stale mirrors in logical volumes

Filelist
========
lvextend.txt
  lvextend  allows you to extend the size of a logical volume.  Extension
  of snapshot logical volumes (see lvcreate(8) for information to  create
  snapshots) is supported as well.

lvreduce.txt
  lvreduce allows you to reduce the size of a logical volume. Be careful when reducing a logical
  volume's size, because data in the reduced part is lost!!!  You should therefore ensure that any
  filesystem on the volume is resized before running lvreduce so that the extents that are to
  be removed are not in use. Shrinking snapshot logical volumes (see lvcreate(8) for information to
  create snapshots) is supported as well.  But to change the number of copies in a mirrored logical
  volume use lvconvert (8).

  Sizes will be rounded if necessary - for example, the volume size must be an exact number
  of extents and the size of a striped segment must be a multiple of the number of stripes.

resize2fs.txt
  Resize ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem on the volume using resize2fs.
