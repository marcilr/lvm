lvreduce - reduce the size of a logical volume
==============================================
lvreduce  [-A/--autobackup  y/n]  [-d/--debug]  [-f/--force]  [-h/-?/--help] {-l/--extents
[-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|FREE}] | -L/--size [-]LogicalVolumeSize[kKmMgGtT]}
[-t/--test] [-v/--verbose] LogicalVolume[Path]

lvreduce allows you to reduce the size of a logical volume. Be careful when reducing a logical
volume's size, because data in the reduced part is lost!!! You should therefore ensure that any
filesystem on the volume is resized before running lvreduce so that the extents that are to
be removed are not in use. Shrinking snapshot logical volumes (see lvcreate(8) for information to
create snapshots) is supported as well.  But to change the number of copies in a mirrored logical
volume use lvconvert (8).

Sizes will be rounded if necessary - for example, the volume size must be an exact number
of extents and the size of a striped segment must be a multiple of the number of stripes.

Example
-------
Reduce /dev/mapper/data-music logical volume from 1TB to 500GB:
bornite:~# lvreduce -L500G /dev/mapper/data-music


Reduce volume
=============
1. Take backup data on volume to reduce.

2. Unmount volume:
# umount /dev/myvg/myvolume

3. The resizefs utility requires e2fsck first:

# e2fsck -f /dev/myvg/myvolume
e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
/dev/mygroup/myvolume: 48/19660800 files (6.3% non-contiguous), 67580459/78643200 blocks
#

4. Reduce the size of the ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem on the volume using resize2fs:

Resize /dev/myvg/myvolume from 1TB to 500GB:
bornite:~# resize2fs /dev/myvg/myvolume 500G
resize2fs 1.40-WIP (14-Nov-2006)
Resizing the filesystem on /dev/myvg/myvolume to 131072000 (4k) blocks.
The filesystem on /dev/myvg/myvolume is now 131072000 blocks long.
bornite:~#

5. Reduce /dev/mygroup/myvolume from 1TB to 500GB:
bornite:~# lvreduce -L500G /dev/myvg/myvolume
  WARNING: Reducing active logical volume to 500.00 GB
  THIS MAY DESTROY YOUR DATA (filesystem etc.)
Do you really want to reduce myvolume? [y/n]: y
  Reducing logical volume myvolume to 500.00 GB
  Logical volume music successfully resized
bornite:~#

6. Mount resized  /dev/myvg/myvolume:

bornite:/# mount /myvg/myvolume/

NOTE: Assume /myvg/myvolume/ is a mount point in fstab.
