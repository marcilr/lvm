LVM (Logical Volume Management) commands.
  lvs          - will list all your LVs, along with their sizes
  vgs          - will give you a quick display of all your VG's
                 sizes and free space

  dmsetup      - low level logical volume management

  lvdisplay    - display attributes of a logical volume
  lvextend     - add space to logical volume
  lvreduce     - reduce size of logical volume
  lvremove     - remove a logical volume
  lvrename     - rename a logical volume
  lvscan       - nice list of logical volumes

  pvcreate     - initialize a disk or partition for use by LVM
  vgcreate     - create a volume group
  vgdisplay    - display attributes of volume groups
  vgextend     - add space to volume group
  vgremove     - remove a volume group
  vgrename     - rename a volume group
  vgscan       - scan all disks for volume groups and rebuild caches

LVM information can be created, displayed, and manipulated with the following
commands:
  lvchange     - Change logical volume characteristics
  lvcreate     - Stripe, create logical volume in volume group
  lvdisplay    - Display information about logical volumes
  lvextend     - Increase space, increase mirrors for logical volume
  lvlnboot     - Prepare logical volume to be root, primary swap, or dump
                 volume
  lvmmigrate   - Prepare root file system for migration from partitions to
                 logical volumes
  lvreduce     - Decrease number of physical extents allocated to logical
                 volume
  lvremove     - Remove one or more logical volumes from volume group
  lvrmboot     - Remove logical volume link to root, primary swap, or dump
                 volume
  pvchange     - Change characteristics of physical volume in volume group
  pvcreate     - Create physical volume for use in volume group
  pvdisplay    - Display information about physical volumes within volume group
  pvmove       - Move allocated physical extents from one physical volume to
                 other physical volumes
  vgcfgbackup  - Create or update volume group configuration backup file
  vgcfgrestore - Display or restore volume group configuration from backup file
  vgchange     - Set volume group availability
  vgcreate     - Create volume group
  vgdisplay    - Display information about volume groups
  vgexport     - Export an volume group and its associated logical volumes
  vgextend     - Extend an volume group by adding physical volumes
  vgimport     - Import an volume group onto the system
  vgreduce     - Remove physical volumes from an volume group
  vgremove     - Remove volume group definition from the system
  vgscan       - Scan physical volumes for volume groups

The following commands are also available if the HP MirrorDisk/UX software is
installed:
  lvmerge      - Merge two logical volumes into one logical volume
  lvsplit      - Split mirrored logical volume into two logical volumes
  lvsync       - Synchronize stale mirrors in logical volumes
  vgsync       - Synchronize stale logical volume mirrors in volume groups

vgchange - change attributes of a volume group
==============================================
To bring a volume group online, the "vgchange" tool:

1. Searches for PVs in all available block devices.
2. Parses the metadata header in each PV found.
3. Computes the layouts of all visible volume groups.
4. Loops over each logical volume in the volume group to be brought online and:
   a. Checks if the logical volume to be brought online has all its PVs visible.
   b. Creates a new, empty device mapping.
   c. Maps it (with the "linear" target) onto the data areas of the PVs the
      logical volume belongs to.

pvmove - move physical extents
==============================
To move an online logical volume between PVs on the same Volume Group, use the
"pvmove" tool:

1. Creates a new, empty device mapping for the destination.

2. Applies the "mirror" target to the original and destination maps. The
   kernel will start the mirror in "degraded" mode and begin copying data from
   the original to the destination to bring it into sync.

3. Replaces the original mapping with the destination when the mirror comes
   into sync, then destroys the original.

These device mapper operations take place transparently, without applications
or filesystems being aware that their underlying storage is moving.

Commands to regain access to your partitions (in case you need to):
  mdadm --assemble /dev/md2 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 
  cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md2 vault 
  vgchange -ay vg (or substitute the name of your LVM volume group for vg
                   here) <== Looks promising.

  Options:
    ay - Availability active

  mount /dev/mapper/vg-* /mount/points

Just for your information, the opposite of these commands are:
  umount /dev/mapper/vg-*
  vgchange -an vg
  cryptsetup luksClose vault
  mdadm --stop /dev/md2
