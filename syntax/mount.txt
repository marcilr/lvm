How to mount Linux LVM volume partitions on Linux
Written on August 28th, 2010 at 23:31 pm by shredder12

So, one of my friends had this weird system breakdown while upgrading Fedora 
from DVD.  Grub couldn't locate the grub.cfg file.  In order to fix the system
and take a backup of some important files, we booted in a live session, mounted
a lvm partition to find out that most of the data was gone.  The end was pretty
bad but I think, just like in my case, there will be many more who wouldn't 
know how to mount a lvm partition.  This little adventure of mine might help 
you out.

In case you have to do something similar just follow the steps we took.

1) Once we were in live session, we opened a terminal and ran:
    [root]# fdisk -l

This lists out the partition table of the system and it looked something like 
this:
    Device      Boot   Start   End   Blocks     Id   System 
    /dev/sda1   *      1       4864  39070048   7    HPFS/NTFS
    /dev/sda2          4865    6691  14675377   83   LVM2_member
    ...

2) The good news was that the system was at least able to distinguish the 
partitions.  So, in order to backup the data, the next step was to access the 
/dev/sda2 partition.  But since it is an lvm partition we will had to take some
additional steps to mount it.

Now, run the pvs command.  Please note that while in live session you may find 
that this is not installed by default.  In order to install the required tools,
run the following command.
    [shredder12]$ sudo apt-get install lvm2

Of course, you should be connected to internet.  Once you are done with this 
run pvs.
    [root]# pvs

This will list the volume groups to which our physical volume /dev/sda2 
belonged.  It would be of the form:
    PV          VG           Fmt    Attr   PSize     PFree
    /dev/hda2   VolGroup01   lvm2   a-     148.94G   32.00M

The second field, VG, shows the Volume group.  The above output is just an 
example, showing that we are concerned with the Volume group "VolGroup01". 
The next step is to list the information about this volume group.
    [root]# lvdisplay /dev/VolGroup01

It will throw a bunch of ouput, but the one we are concerned with is LV Name.
It will look something like this:
    LV Name /dev/VolGroup01/LogVol00

In our case, there were two entries of type LV Name, the other being LogVol01, 
the swap.  The whole output along with it will help you to identify the target 
logical volume you are looking for.  Assuming that the above one is the 
partition that we need to mount, just use the usual method to mount it.
    [root]# mount /dev/VolGroup01/LogVol00    /mnt

Now, you can to find the data you were looking for in the /mnt folder.

=============================
Example run on malachite.


1. Lists disks with fdisk.  Booted to debian squeeze 6.0.2
installed on 80GB sata attached tpo mobo.

root@malachite:/home/marcilr# fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80026361856 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9729 cylinders

root@malachite:/home/marcilr# 


2. Install lvm2 package:
root@malachite:~# aptitude install lvm2
...
Setting up LVM Volume Groups  Reading all physical volumes.  \
This may take a while...
  Found volume group "malachite" using metadata type lvm2
  2 logical volume(s) in volume group "malachite" now active
...
root@malachite:~#


3. Run pvs - report information about physical volumes
root@malachite:~# pvs
  PV         VG        Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree
  /dev/sdb5  malachite lvm2 a-   148.75g    0 
root@malachite:~# 


4. List information about malachite volume group.
It will throw a bunch of output, but the one we are concerned 
with is LV Name:

root@malachite:~# lvdisplay /dev/malachite | grep "LV Name"
  LV Name                /dev/malachite/root
  LV Name                /dev/malachite/swap_1
root@malachite:~#


root@malachite:~# lvdisplay /dev/malachite
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Name                /dev/malachite/root
  VG Name                malachite

  Block device           254:0
   
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Name                /dev/malachite/swap_1
  VG Name                malachite
  LV UUID                bLwuSz-gjgH-7YqX-GMhE-IfLj-urF6-qtV19A
  LV Write Access        read/write
  LV Status              available
  # open                 0
  LV Size                6.06 GiB
  Current LE             1552
  Segments               1
  Allocation             inherit
  Read ahead sectors     auto
  - currently set to     256
  Block device           254:1
   
root@malachite:~# 

5. Mount logical volume:

root@malachite:~# mount /dev/malachite/root /mnt
marcilr@malachite:~$ ls /mnt
bin   etc      initrd.img  lib64       mnt   README  selinux  tmp  vmlinuz
boot  exports  lib         lost+found  opt   root    srv      usr
dev   home     lib32       media       proc  sbin    sys      var
marcilr@malachite:~$ 

marcilr@malachite:~$ df -m
Filesystem           1M-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1                72032     20463     47910  30% /
...
/dev/mapper/malachite-root
                        143815    134118      2392  99% /mnt
marcilr@malachite:~$

The mount of the logical volume group definately worked.
