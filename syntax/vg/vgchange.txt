vgchange - change attributes of a volume group


vgchange allows you to change the attributes of one or more volume groups.
Its main purpose is to activate and deactivate VolumeGroupName, or all
volume groups if none is specified.  Only active volume groups are subject
to changes and allow access to their logical volumes. 


Options
=======
...

-a, --available [e|l]{y|n}
    Controls the availability of the logical volumes in the volume group for
    input/output.  In other words, makes the logical volumes known/unknown to
    the kernel.

    If clustered locking is enabled, add 'e' to activate/deactivate exclude or
    'l' to activate/deactivate only on the local node.  Logical volumes with
    single-host snapshots are always activated exclusively because they can
    only be used on one node at once.

Example
=======
On GCI Network Services, OSS covellite debian wheezy 7.6 amd64 workstation I
had an external eSATA 2TB Seagate ST32000641AS Barracuda XT drive attached
with volume group tennantite with LVMs on /dev/sdc4 1700GB partition.
However when I connected and turned on the drive tennantite's LVMs were not
immediately visible under /dev/tennantite/*

The trick was activating the tennantite volume gorup with vgchange:

covellite:~# /sbin/vgchange -a y tennantite

This made tennantite's LVMs available under /dev/tennantite/* as follows:

covellite:~$ ls /dev/tennantite/
backups  debs  iso  perforce  svn  talend  vms  wallpaper
covellite:~$

Very good.
